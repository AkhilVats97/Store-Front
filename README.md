# Store-Front

This is a Django-based storefront project that allows users to browse and purchase products online. The storefront includes features such as user authentication and authorization, shopping cart functionality, payment integration, order management, and product search and filtering.

The project is built using Python 3 and the Django web framework, and leverages several third-party libraries and APIs to provide a seamless shopping experience. The Stripe API is used for payment processing, while the USPS API is used for calculating shipping rates.
This project is open source and available for anyone to use, modify, or contribute to. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to help us continue to improve the storefront and provide a great shopping experience for users.
